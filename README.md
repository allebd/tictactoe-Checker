## About

An application ticTacToeCheck that takes a two dimensional array representing a
finished game of tic-tac-toe (e.g. [["XO-"], ["XXX"], ["XO-"]]).
* X represents player 1 move(s).
* O represents player 2 move(s).
* Dash (-) represents no move(s).

## Context

Mike and his friend love playing tic-tac-toe. In fact, they love it so much they created a
multiplayer web version to play remotely against each other. At the last minute, Mike
realized he forgot to call an animation when a player won the game. Now he needs to
create an application that will check it but can't do it himself because he's short on time.
This application helps solve mike's problem.
